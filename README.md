# Art-Py Lab â€“ Blender + Python Worldbuilding

**Overview**  
This project explores **creative automation and 3D worldbuilding** using Python scripts in Blender. It combines coding and design to generate scenes, animations, and data-driven visuals. Outputs include procedural landscapes, stock-driven motion graphics, and example immersive scenes.

---

## Strategies Explored

- **Python Scripting** â€“ automated Blender workflows for generating and animating 3D objects.  
- **Generative Scenes** â€“ procedural landscapes and populated worlds built directly from code.  
- **Animation** â€“ custom animations including a stock movement visualization driven by real market data.  
- **Immersive Design** â€“ example 3D `.blend` files showcasing colorful, low-poly worlds and creative layouts.
